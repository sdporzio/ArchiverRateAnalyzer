# ArchiverRateAnalyzer
Analyzes channel data rate for the Slow Monitor

In order to use it source "sourceMe.sh". You must be in the ArchiverRateAnalyzer folder.
Run "extractRates.py" to get the rate for the channels and plotRates.ipynb (jupyter notebook) to plot data.

You have to change variables in these two files if you want different channels.
If you have problems send me an email. Or ask, if I'm around.
